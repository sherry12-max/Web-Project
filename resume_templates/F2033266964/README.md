## üé® Design Inspiration & Notes (100-150 words)

My corporate executive resume template draws inspiration from luxury business publications and high-end corporate branding, emphasizing sophistication and authority. The design features an elegant navy blue color scheme (#1e3a8a to #3730a3) that conveys trust, professionalism, and executive presence. I chose the Playfair Display font for headings to add elegance, paired with Source Sans Pro for body text to ensure readability.

Unique elements include a distinguished header with executive-style typography, premium section dividers with subtle shadows, and a refined three-column layout that maximizes content while maintaining elegance. The template incorporates advanced CSS techniques for sophisticated visual effects while ensuring perfect A4 print compatibility through WeasyPrint. Achievement metrics are highlighted prominently, and the overall design philosophy focuses on conveying leadership, experience, and corporate excellence. This template is ideal for C-level executives, senior managers, and established professionals seeking to project authority and competence.
