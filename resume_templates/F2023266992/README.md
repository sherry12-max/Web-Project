## üé® Design Inspiration & Notes (100-150 words)

My creative portfolio resume template draws inspiration from modern art galleries and contemporary design studios, emphasizing bold colors and dynamic layouts. The design features a striking orange gradient (#ff6b35 to #f7931e) that creates energy and creativity while maintaining professional appeal. I chose the Montserrat font family for its modern geometric characteristics and strong visual presence.

Unique elements include an asymmetric two-column layout with creative section dividers, vibrant color blocks for visual interest, and artistic typography treatments. The template incorporates CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive behavior while ensuring perfect A4 print compatibility through WeasyPrint. Portfolio sections use card-based layouts, and skills are represented through creative visual indicators. The design philosophy balances artistic expression with professional functionality, creating an eye-catching yet readable resume perfect for designers, artists, marketers, and other creative professionals seeking to showcase their personality.
